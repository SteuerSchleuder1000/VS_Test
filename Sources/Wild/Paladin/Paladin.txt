Blizzard has answered the debate over whether Mid-Range Paladin should run Recruit synergy or Murloc synergy with a swift nerf to Murloc Warleader. As a result, the Murloc variant dropped to Tier 3 despite nerfs to other agressive decks. With the Murloc Warleader change, Murloc Paladin can’t snowball an early game advantage as effectively and is much more vulnerable to the large menu of board clears available in Wild.

Murloc Warleader isn’t completely dead though. With the recent popularity of Reno Priest, some have turned towards the Anyfin Package to burst the Reno Priest before they can develop their own burst damage. While this may have been effective at first, Reno Priests have very quickly  focused on card draw, equalizing the advantage Anyfin Paladin once had. With this note, we’ll continue to keep an eye out for this variant as the meta continues to develop.

Being among the strongest KFT decks unaffected by the nerfs, Recruit Paladin has made a valiant return to Tier 1 at all levels of play. Recruit Paladin struggled against the Jade Druid lists prior to the Innervate and Spreading Plague changes. While these nerfs certainly help the archetype rise in the ranks, Recruit Paladin has been kept in check by the newest arrivals, Tempo Rogue and Zoo Warlock. These decks are often just a step ahead of Recruit Paladin’s game plan. Tempo Rogue and Zoo Warlock, along with aggressive Druids, can overwhelm Recruit Paladin with better and faster board floods. If these tempo decks continue to rise, Recruit Paladin could find its power level dropping once again.

Secret Paladin offers an enticing option for Paladin to combat the new Tempo decks. Fighting fire with fire, or in this case tempo with tempo, Secret Paladin may prove to be the best archetype for Paladin moving forward even though its play rate is quite low. In this report, we tentatively place Secret Paladin in Tier 1, as it seems to be a very promising performer based on its small sample size.
