Mage has reached quite a stagnant point with its archetypes. Many of the decklists have barely changed with the post-nerf meta. The main archetypes of Mage that are still seeing a regular amount of play are Tempo, Reno, and Exodia Mage.

Exodia Mage drastically declined in playability due to Jade Druid’s recent nerfs. Exodia Mage has mainly Priest to “counter”, which isn’t even a strongly favored matchup. With wider and more aggressive decks in the meta, thanks to the Spreading Plague nerf, Exodia Mage becomes weaker. For these reasons, Exodia Mage should only be used when you can target a specific meta.

Reno Mage is a very solid control deck that has a lot of flexibility against a variety of decks. With Frost Lich Jaina, Reno Mage has the potential to close out games from the accumulation of serious card advantage in the late game. Druid’s nerf has benefitted Reno Mage tremendously since it’s one of the deck’s worst matchups. It also can perform well against current builds of Reno Priest with Ice Block into Reno, but it is still unfavored against Reno Priest, as the Priest can often find their combo much faster than Reno Mage can apply pressure.

Tempo Mage has started to shine a little more in the meta with two different variations of the deck. One focuses more on secret synergies, while the other focuses on Flamewaker synergies to secure tempo. With the meta still relatively slow, Tempo Mage’s main weakness (aggressive decks: as they can easily play around secrets and clear low health minions) is lessened. Tempo Mage is able to develop secrets that protect their minions, allowing for a lot of cumulative face damage. The ability to negate midrange and control players the opportunity to come back or develop allows Tempo Mage to maintain a reasonable presence in the meta.
