Spreading Plague has had its mana cost increased by one, and Innervate is now essentially the Coin. Many players believed that Jade Druid would be unaffected by these changes and that Aggro-Token Druid would be dead. It turns out this was far from the truth. In Wild, Jade Druid has fallen to the bottom of Tier 3 and Aggro-Token Druid is now the top deck to beat in Wild. In fact, Aggro-Token Druidâ€™s win rate has increased since the last report!

The prolonged life of Aggro-Token Druid in Wild can be explained by Wild-specific cards such as Haunted Creeper and Jeeves. The most popular build of Aggro-Token Druid has also been teched with double Crazed Alchemists to improve its win rate against bad matchups such as Inner-Fire Priest, Reno Priest, and Reno Warlock. Being able to remove a Doomsayer on Turn 2 or eliminate the threat of a Deathlord can be a huge tempo swing. Crazed Alchemist can also be used in conjunction with Crypt Lord and Savage Roar for insane bursts for lethal. Vicious Fledging is no longer popular in Aggro-Token Druid, since it was only truly Wild playable ahead of curve. It should be noted that Egg Druid builds were unaffected by the Innervate change since these lists did not run the card.

Jade Druid has taken a big hit because of the change to Innervate. To account for this change many Jade Druid players have included additional Ramp like Pilfered Power or Mire Keeper. Although Spreading Plague is still a great card at six mana, the Innervate change has made the deck exceptionally weak to aggressive decks in Wild. Giants Druid also faces the same problem with the ability to cheat out an early Naga Sea Witch made more difficult. Without tools to manage its inconsistency, it lands itself in a weak spot in the meta, dropping all the way down to Tier 4.
