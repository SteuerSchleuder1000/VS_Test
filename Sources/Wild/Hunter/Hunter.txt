Hunter is in an awkward spot, yet again. Despite having 3 semi-viable archetypes, its unfavorable matchups across the board against the best decks make Hunter a dicey proposition.

Giants Hunter sits on top of the pack. As a giants deck, it loses to most popular aggro decks, which keeps it from being better than it is. Most of the build is fairly standard, with the giants package containing Molten, Mountain, and Sea giants, with Clockwork giants also being reasonably popular.

Deathrattle hunter is the second best hunter deck; it feels like it loses to itself more than anything else. With the right hand, it’s a scary proposition, making large boards early that the opponent can’t easily clear. It can also draw upside down and not be able to play anything meaningful before turn 4, a death sentence on ladder. Stitched Tracker helps address this inconsistency, but its draw-smoothing is dwarfed by the scale of the problem.

The traditional Midrange Hunter is currently the worst of the bunch, mostly due to its inflexibility, and a lack of meaningful synergy. It gets outpaced by other midrange decks such as Recruit Paladin, and outvalued by slower decks. Having no real comeback mechanics and matching up poorly against almost all of Priest’s removal make Midrange Hunter’s life tougher.
