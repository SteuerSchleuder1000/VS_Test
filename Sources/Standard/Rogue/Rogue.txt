<p>This is a new meta, and a new time for Rogue to shine once again. One of the least represented classes before the balance changes, Rogue is now one of the most popular and dominant classes across all ranks.</p>
<p>Rogue's increased popularity is led by the rise of <strong>Tempo Rogue</strong>, the archetype that carries the highest win rate in the game. Prince Keleseth and Shadowstep allow for some very one-sided games and force opponents to quickly reach for the bottom right button. However, the real power of the deck, and the reason for its consistency, is its ability to win when it is not able to find its best draw.</p>
<p>Vilespine Slayer, Bonemare and SI:7 Agent enable tempo swings that truly justify the deckís name - Tempo Rogue. Neutral 5-drops such as Bittertide Hydra (which excels against Druid) and Cobalt Scalebane (which excels against Priest) give the deck the kind of punching power that allows it to capitalize on these tempo swings to end the game. When these kind of threats are further buffed by Prince Keleseth, the deck reaches its full potential.</p>
<p>The Pirate package is also a key part of the deck. If you thought Patches was a menace before, just wait until he is shooting out of a cannon as a 2/2, a 3/3 or greater. Southsea Deckhands and Leeroy Jenkins provide the finishing burst, especially when combined with Cold Blood or Shadowstep. Shadowstep is a versatile card in the deck, going beyond the use with Prince Keleseth to synergize with many of these decksí minions due to their powerful battlecries.</p>
<p>Many players have reached high legend ranks with the archetype. Asmodai was one of the early innovators, reaching #1 legend with his list, which includes Shadowcaster and forgoes the Bittertide Hydras/Cobalt Scalebanes. Mr Yagut's #2 legend list differs from Asmodai's by 2 cards, with a Plague Scientist and a Lotus Assassin replacing a Cold Blood and the Shadowcaster. Ryzen reached #3 legend with a heavier mid-game build that favors Cobalt Scalebanes over Bittertide Hydras. This build, with either Hydras or Scalebanes, performs better in slower matchups such as Priest and Jade Druid. Corbett hit top 10 with an Elemental build thatís stronger in aggressive mirrors for the cost of burst potential.</p>
<p><strong>Miracle Rogue</strong> remains on the fringes, and itís struggling due to the fast pace of the meta. Builds from Casie and Zanananan have been successful in the early days post-patch, but have fizzled out since.</p>
<p><strong>Quest Rogue</strong> has had a notable achievement this week, with Yangbongkun hitting top 10 legend with the archetype. The deck looks to prey on Priests and Jade Druid, but will have a hard time queuing into aggressive decks.</p>
