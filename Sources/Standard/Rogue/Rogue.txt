Tempo Rogue continues to flourish the meta, and it does so with incredible diversity in its builds. The archetype is so flexible that it’s capable of fitting many different cards in order to see success in different situations. The standard Hydra/Scalebane lists we feature are only the tip of the iceberg, and make for good starting points. You should consider them as benchmark lists that can be significantly altered.

Barnes continues to be a popular 4-drop for Scalebane lists. Ike won Dreamhack Denver by running Barnes and the Lich King instead of Shaku and a Cold Blood, gearing the deck towards the Priest matchup while taking a Rogue ban into account. Valanar is often seen in lists that run Bittertide Hydra, and Xaril is also a card that sees play in either variant. Some players opt to reduce the deck’s burst package (Leeroy, Cold Blood, Shadowstep) for threat density, running both Scalebanes and Hydras. Janetzky took it one step further by running Chillwind Yeti at the 4 slot, in addition to all the 5-drops, heavily targeting Priests and Druids. Tar Creeper is very strong in the mirror and against aggressive decks, but is weak against Druid and Priest, which is why it is often flexed out for Vicious Fledglings. Some players, such as SoLegit, are running bigger burgle packages with Hallucination and Obsidian Shards. Gyong hit #1 legend with a non-Keleseth list that runs Eviscerates. Finally, you have the Corpsetaker variants that take the deck into an entirely different direction.

What we’re trying to emphasize is that Tempo Rogue has a very small core of must include cards and seems to do no wrong when it comes to its experimentation, seeing success with many different variants. In addition, the incredible flexibility makes it the most valuable deck in the tournament scene, and it’s hard to imagine a line-up that doesn’t include it. In Last Hero Standing, it is a sweeping threat against any line up, making it the most popular ban by a significant margin. In Conquest, you can gear it to beat pretty much anything.

Other Rogue archetypes aren’t so lucky, and they have fallen massively behind. Miracle Rogue is displaying an incredibly poor win rate, which often occurs to an archetype that is abandoned. It’s not as bad as it looks, but it’s still pretty weak against the field.
