There have been some new, yet old, faces appearing in the Rogue world. Twink and Gyong have been playing Quest Rogue at high legend in this early portion of the season. Twink peaked at #4 Legend on EU, whereas Gyong peaked at #8 Legend on Asia. Both lists are fairly similar and familiar, with Twink opting for two Coldlight Oracles to assist in getting the pieces to complete the quest, whereas Gyong opted for a Doomsayer and a Backstab in order to help in aggressive matchups. The deck is still able to pray on control decks, but is extremely weak to decks such as Aggro Druid and Pirate Warrior. The balance changes may help it find its spot in the new meta, as it is still quite effective at beating Priest and Jade Druid.

The upcoming balance changes may affect Rogue in a positive light overall, as the top aggressive decks which prey on most Rogue archetypes will be weakened. In addition, Innervate is a very important card in the Jade Druid matchup, so it might help Miracle Rogue gain back percentages it has lost against Jade Druid since KFTâ€™s release. Rogue is not expected to suddenly be a top dog in the meta, but could at least improve and adjust better to a new meta centered on Priest.
