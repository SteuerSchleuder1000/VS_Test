Murloc Paladin still has a very strong win rate, but the class continues to linger towards the bottom in terms of representation. Murloc Paladin does fairly well against Priests and Jade Druid but has a very difficult time against Tempo Rogue. This weakness is likely the root cause of Murloc Paladin’s underrepresentation. Other Paladin archetypes are fairly stagnant in terms of development, and we don’t have much to say about them this week.

The big story this week is Alpha’s #19 legend Murloc Paladin list that cuts Tidecallers and features Menagerie Magician, which has Stegodon (from Spikeridged Steed), Gentle Megasaur and Cobalt Scalebane as non-Murloc targets. This deck is highly teched to beat Jade Druid, as the various buffs as well as the Magician can create really oppressive board states that the Druid’s toolkit cannot handle. Since the deck carries so much mid-game power, it also does decently against Priests (the Curator/Scalebane builds are the best choice if you want to beat Priests). The weaker early game and heavier reliance on minions to stick, however, makes your Tempo Rogue matchup even worse, so be mindful of that before taking the list to ladder.
