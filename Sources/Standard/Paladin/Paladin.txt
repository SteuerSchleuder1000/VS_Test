Murloc Paladin is certainly showing great results behind iterations running The Curator and Cobalt Scalebanes, and it’s in a fantastic spot in the meta considering it’s so often underestimated.

These cards give the deck strong on-curve plays throughout the game and provide the deck with longevity – something that Tempo Rogue can sometimes lack against Priest and Druid, once they stabilize. Jambre hit #1 Legend with a list utilizing Dread Corsair and Patches in order to maximize tempo through weapons. It is also possible to hold the 0 cost Dread Corsair until the next turn in order to attach it to a buff. The weapon package helps the deck fight for the board in the early game against aggressive decks, which is generally a struggle for the archetype, especially in matchups such as Tempo Rogue. GinjaNinja hit #27 legend by adding Golakka Crawlers, a different means to fight for the board against Rogue in the early game without potentially clogging your hand with too many weapons. Cocof hit #44 with a list that’s fairly light in tech.

One trend we’re noticing is the inclusion of Grimscale Chums over Argent Protectors, the latter being a low pressure minion against Priest and Druids, while Chums can enable some more explosive starts. Another card that’s more often seen is Coldlight Seer, which is very strong against Druids in particular since the health buff usually means they can no longer deal with your board directly using their removal.

Not much has changed for the other archetypes. Handbuff Paladin was a fun experiment, but Tempo Rogue is a better Keleseth-based deck. The deck seems inconsistent and strictly worse than Murloc Paladin. Control Paladin is slow and doesn’t actually have any matchups that are good enough to reward you for taking it out on ladder.
