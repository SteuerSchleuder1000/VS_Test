<p><strong>Murloc Paladin</strong> is still very much a thing and is quite a strong deck, despite seeing significantly less play. It has the same poor matchups that it had before (aggressive mirrors, mainly Shaman and Rogue), but is positioned pretty decently against the rest of the field. Not much has changed in terms of builds, with Corpsetakers being stronger in aggressive mirrors, while running a Curator package with Scalebanes should improve your matchup against Priest.</p>
<p><strong>Handbuff Paladin</strong> is still being championed by Brian ìPlease donít call me ìBrian ìBrian Kiblerî Kiblerî Kibler, who piloted his new brew to legend after the patch went live. Cobalt Scalebane makes another appearance as the Priest hate levels rise in the meta. Much like Bonemare and Spikeridged Steed, it can create a ìmust answerî board seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Kito peaked as high as #10 legend with a <strong>Control Paladin</strong> list. One of the main problems with playing this archetype on ladder is the guaranteed long games and lack of a blowout late game plan (a la Razakus Priest). Dirty Rats are becoming more popular in the meta as they provide counter play to Raza. Watch your opponentís mulligan and look to play Dirty Rat just before their turn 5. Consider adding a Skulking Geist to have a better chance against Jade Druid.</p>
