Murloc Paladin continues to rule the roost for this class with Mistuhide hitting #8 legend with a drastically altered build. He has pushed the deck further towards all-out aggression, capping his curve at 6 while running Divine Favor. For now, this archetype is king of the Paladin class, but for how much longer? With the balance changes around the corner, this archetype stands to lose out significant power with Murloc Warleader no longer granting extra health. This makes value trading harder while also, and more importantly, making the Murloc tribe much more vulnerable to AoE damage effects.

It’s very hard to predict what will happen to Murloc Paladin after the balance changes. On one hand, its power level in a vacuum is reduced. However, Pirate Warrior and Aggro-Token Druid could also see a significant reduction in their representation, being some of Murloc Paladin’s more difficult challenges. It’s possible that aggressive Paladin decks will drop their murloc tribe core, or shift to faster builds such as Mitsuhide’s, since the slower builds might not be able to stick to the board consistently enough against control decks anymore.

Control Paladin continues to flounder, but that might change if the meta slows down. It all depends on how greedy the ladder meta becomes. In its current iteration, Control Paladin loses to Razakus Priest pretty terribly, as well as to Jade Druid, and both decks are not expected to go anywhere after the balance changes. This archetype could see a renaissance, but it needs to shed its anti-aggro techs in favor of a more proactive game plan, and it needs card draw in order to be able to execute an OTK/Beardo plan, one potential answer to Druids and Priests.
