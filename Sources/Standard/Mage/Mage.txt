Mage has settled into a middle-of-the-road spot in terms of representation, with three archetypes that see a modest amount of play. Secret and Control Mage are more popular overall, but at higher levels of play, Exodia Mage overtakes them. This is likely due to the increasing amount of Jade Druids and Priests, with players looking to gain an edge specifically against them.

Secret Mage does well against the slower decks of the meta, but is hurt by the influx of Tempo Rogue. The deck’s main weakness lies in its inability to deal with wide boards outside of a Primordial Glyph pull. Secret Mage excels when it has the initiative and protects its board with Counterspell, but struggles to come back to the game once it falls behind and is forced to play catch-up.

Control Mage hasn’t seen much change this week, and struggles to balance around having enough tools to deal with aggressive decks while maintaining some form of resistance against Priests and Jade Druids.

Compared to the other Mage decks in the meta, Exodia Mage is the weakest against the field. Its biggest assets are decent matchups against Razakus Priest and Jade Druid, so it does retain a niche on ladder with players hoping to snipe these matchups, but you generally don’t want to run into most other decks on ladder.
