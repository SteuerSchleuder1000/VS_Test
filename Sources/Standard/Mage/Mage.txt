Mage has room for optimism when it comes to the balance changes, with both Exodia Mage and Secret Mage potentially benefitting from the meta shift. Both archetypes suffer at the hands of aggressive decks while maintaining good win rates against the Priest class. Pirate Warrior is one of the biggest obstacles to the class’ success on ladder, and its possible disappearance is a big sigh of relief. Fiery War Axe was the biggest counter to Secret Mage’s early game. With all of its minions falling prey to the weapon, the Mage just could not develop a board in response to a turn 2 War Axe, often being run over by the Warrior’s snowballing synergies. Needless to say, Exodia Mage’s matchup against Pirate Warrior is one of the most lop-sided affairs in the game.

The change to Innervate, which significantly limits Token Druid’s explosive starts, also affects these decks’ matchups against Jade Druid. Innervate was an excellent fodder to Counterspell, and without it, Jade Druids will have a much more difficult time playing around the Secret Mage’s most powerful and core secret. In addition, the Innervate change means that Druid will have a more difficult time consistently pressuring Exodia Mage before it is able to execute its combo. Note that we don’t expect Exodia Mage to suddenly become a top tier deck, but its win rate could be pushed into a range where it is a more consistent ladder deck.

We’re less optimistic when it comes to Control Mage, or pure Freeze Mage, because of these archetypes’ poor matchups against Priest. It’s not out of the question that attrition based Mage decks emerge, but it requires more pieces to fall into place.
