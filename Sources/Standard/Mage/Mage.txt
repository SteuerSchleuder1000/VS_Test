<p><strong>Secret Mage</strong> is currently the most popular Mage deck in this post-patch meta. This is unsurprising since its strong early game no longer has to compete with a War Axe farming its minions, or Druid innervating out an annoying mana-cheating play. Eloise hit top 50 legend with a variant of the deck that includes Bittertide Hydra and Bonemare for a more powerful minion-based mid- to late-game that can really put the heat on Jade Druids and Priests. Another option is to forgo the Hydras for Burgly Bullies and add Antonidas instead of a second Bonemare. This makes the deck less explosive, but still keeps it quite dangerous for the aforementioned decks.</p>
<p>Breezyy reached #11 legend with a Frost Lich <strong>Control Mage</strong> that includes Elise and Sindragosa. This build carries a lot of value which ensures a very strong late game plan in control matchups. Skulking Geist prevents the infinite value plan of Jade Druid, making the matchup more manageable. However, the archetype struggles against Shadowreaper Anduin so trust other Mage decks if you are facing a lot of Razakus Priest.</p>
<p><strong>Exodia Mage</strong> is the third significantly played Mage deck. It is decent against Jade Druid, and is the strongest counter to Razakus Priest, but has miserable matchups against aggressive decks. This makes it potentially a more enticing option in tournaments rather than ladder, in a lineup meant to target the two most popular tournament decks (though it is more of a soft counter to Jade Druid).</p>
