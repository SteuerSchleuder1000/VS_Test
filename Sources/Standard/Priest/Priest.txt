Razakus Priest, while still being a strong, meta-defining deck, has lost some of its footing entering the last week of the season. Just about everyone has officially remembered just how good Malfurion is as well as his Ultimate Infestations. Jade Druid, as well as other emerging counters, are heavily suppressing Razakus’ Priest performance against the field.

Razakus Priest has one great thing going for it, which is a decent matchup against Tempo Rogue. In a Rogue-dominated meta and a pocket field that doesn’t have as many Druids, the deck can still find great success, and multiple players have been taking the archetype to top legend ranks.

Standard builds have remained similar across the board, though some players are beginning to cut the more situational anti-aggro cards for a better chance against Jade Druid and the mirror. Hunterace took a Lyra build to #1 legend, running Dirty Rat, Kabal Talonpriest and Holy Fire instead of the Pint/Horror combo and Binding Heal. Other players have begun to cut the Pint/Horror combo as well and experimenting with other cards. One of the most interesting new choices in the deck is Giant Wasp, initially used by Satellite. It acts as a pre-emptive removal tool to answer the big threats that many decks are running to beat Priest, such as Hydra or Scalebane. Another card that flexes in and out of the deck is Tar Creeper, due to its strength against Rogue.

Other Priest archetypes continue to look very promising. Big Priest fares closer to a coin flip against Jade Druid while also serving as a counter to its Razakus counterpart, putting it in a strong position in the meta. Dragon Priest has made a breakthrough behind Mitsuhide hitting #2 legend with a new build for the archetype. Hunterace hit #1 (again) with the same build, while SirVilgaudas, the pioneer of the deck, hit #28 by swapping one Scalebane for Deathwing. This incarnation of Dragon Priest is quite unique, being a midrange deck with a full combo finisher. Much like Silence Priest, which has been performing very well too, it runs the Divine Spirit/Inner Fire/Shadow Visions package and looks to OTK low pressure decks such as Razakus Priest through one seemingly harmless minion on the board. Against Jade Druid, Dragon and Silence Priest can utilize the combo much earlier to make a big minion and start hitting face, since Jade Druid has no way to deal with a big threat effectively. This strategy is proving to be very effective, and has begun to populate higher levels of play.

Multiple players hit top legend ranks with Silence Priest, a deck that looks to be very strong against the established meta. Florindo hit #2 legend with a build that runs Golakka Crawler and Bittertide Hydra, Nuj hit #18 with the same build, while Duck hit #14 with a list that runs the Pyromancer/Circle package.
