Anduin and Tyrande certainly are in uncharted territory. As a heavy favorite to become the strongest class in Hearthstone, Priest is possibly at its best since the inception of standard, with seemingly nowhere to go but up. With Druid’s consistency being reduced, and Pirate Warrior possibly completely disappearing, all iterations of Priest should benefit greatly. It is already observed in the tournament scene, where a Druid ban heavily forces the field towards Priest dominance.

Specifically, Razakus Priest has been tearing up the Druid-less tournament scene while also achieving success on ladder. TicTac took his variant to #6 legend in the week leading up to the balance changes, sporting Burgly Bully in his build. Bully is extremely strong in the Priest mirror and the list, in general, is geared to do well in a Priest heavy meta, with Prophet Velen as well as Greater Healing Potion also included.

The EZ Big EZ Priest’s biggest weakness on ladder is Pirate Warrior, so expect its win rate to spike going forward as well. It is a soft counter to Razakus Priest, so its potential in the new metagame is possibly being slept on. This archetype’s progress will be a huge note to monitor going forward.

Zetalot hit top 20 legend playing with a Control Priest build that seemingly did well against Jade Druid. It’ll be interesting to see whether another Priest archetype emerges in significant numbers as a result of the balance changes.
