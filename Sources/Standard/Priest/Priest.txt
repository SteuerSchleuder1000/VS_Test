<p>Itís happened. Priest is the most popular class in Hearthstone, which is not surprising considering the lead up to the balance changes. Razakus Priest was the strongest deck which was left completely unchanged by the balance patch. Since this is the case, itís obviously a great comfort pick for the players trying to climb with a deck they already know is strong.</p>
<p><strong>Razakus Priest</strong> is a bit unique in terms of builds. Multiple players have hit #1 legend with it, and every one of them teched his build according to a local meta he was facing. So, the archetype is more punishing to netdeck without thought than other archetypes since some techs are a big hindrance if theyíre brought to a different meta than the narrow one often seen at top legend. The deck, as a result, is difficult to optimize.</p>
<p>This is why weíre featuring two lists that are light in tech and share 26 core cards, which are good as a benchmark and a solid starting point. Both lists feature Velen/Mind Blast, as the combo is important in the Jade Druid matchup, a deck thatís expected to rise in play. The first is a standard build that maximizes cycle, inspired by Feno. The flex spots are Tar Creeper (strong against aggro in general), Gnomish Inventor, Cabal Shadow Priest and Greater Healing Potion. The second list is inspired by Zalae, and includes the Auchenai/Circle combo, along with Wild Pyromancer and Binding Heal, which work well with each other and Circle of Healing.</p>
<p>There are many other cards that often see play in Razakus Priest builds. Kabal Talonpriest and Kabal Courier are common 3-drops. Golakka Crawler is mostly relevant these days in the Rogue matchup. Holy Nova can provide an extra board clear against Shamans and aggressive Druids and doubles up as potential card draw with Cleric. Gluttonous Ooze is less recommended due to the decline in Warriors and Paladins. Skulking Geist can help against Druids and Shamans, but the primary game plan against Jade Druid with a Mind Blast list is burning them down before being overwhelmed, and your own 1-cost spells are important for that. Elise also does not contribute to the burst plan, so doesnít make sense with Mind Blast. Other notable techs: Mass Dispel (Shaman), Big Game Hunter (Hydra), Dirty Rat (Mirror, Exodia Mage), Coldlight Oracle (Jade Druid), Eater of Secrets (Exodia Mage).</p>
<p><strong>Big Priest</strong> is still out there and can catch you off guard if youíre not ready for it. Its ability to high-roll its way into a blow-out turn 4 Barnes play cannot be underestimated. The deck is also a soft counter to its counterpart in Razakus Priest. C0ntrol Boy took a variant with Mind Vision to #3 legend this past week, and it appears to be a possible sleeper deck going forward as everyone focuses on its more popular counterpart.</p>
