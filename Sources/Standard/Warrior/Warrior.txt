<p>The nerf to Fiery War Axe has, predictably, gutted the Warrior class. It is the least popular class at every rank, possibly for the first time in the classí history. All is not lost though, as <strong>Pirate Warrior</strong> is actually still a pretty good deck, and while nowhere near as good as before the War Axe change, it is still acceptable to climb with and will probably rise in popularity again after the player base realizes this.</p>
<p>Zlsjs hit #1 legend this week, keeping the War Axe in the deck. The lack of a power play at the 2 mana slot is solved by aggressive decksí new darling in Prince Keleseth. Fire Fly offers a pseudo 2-drop that dodges the build limitation imposed by the Prince, and is a good card in general due to the abundance of Patches. Bittertide Hydras continue to be nailed on staples thanks to their strength in the matchup against Druid and Priest. To make way for Keleseth, Bloodsail Raider and Heroic Strike are cut. With War Axeís increased mana cost, Bloodsail Raider is a much worse card anyway, while Heroic Strike is also easily cut since itís one of the worst cards in your bad matchups.</p>
<p>That was all she wrote. There is nothing else of interest in the Warrior class. Tempo Warrior ceases to become Tempo without a 2 mana War Axe, while slower builds just fall far behind without their best tool at fending off early aggression. Itís very unlikely that any Warrior not named Pirate will be even remotely successful until the new expansion at the earliest, and even then, a lot needs to be done.</p>
