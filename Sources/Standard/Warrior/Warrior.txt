Pirate Warrior still has a respectable win rate, and some players continue to have success with the archetype. Zeh hit top 100 legend by adding the late game package of Cairne and Bonemares, making Pirate Warrior yet another archetype that utilizes Bonemares. If you haven’t noticed by now, Bonemare is kind of a good card.

No other archetypes have been successful for Warrior recently. Monsanto’s top 4 finish at Dreamhack Denver demonstrates that it is possible to have success with Warrior in a tournament setting, but it’s not worth much on ladder. It is the least popular class for a reason. If you do feel a need to jam Control Warrior on ladder, perhaps out of self-loathing, Fibonacci’s N’Zoth list is probably your best bet.
