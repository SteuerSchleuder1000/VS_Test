It’s another miserable week for Warrior. Pirate Warrior’s win rate remains acceptable, with decent matchups against Jade Druid and Razakus Priest, but it struggles against Tempo Rogue and is simply outclassed by it since it is much more vulnerable to being countered.

There have been very little developments when it comes to other Warrior archetypes, which show very little signs of life. Taka hit #17 legend with a Taunt Warrior build that drops Fiery War Axe and runs one Golakka Crawler. These cases of individual success can happen, but they aren’t necessarily indicative of hidden potential. Fatigue Warrior builds continue to exhibit some of the worst win rates you can measure. There is no doubt that the Fiery War Axe nerf absolutely killed the class, and the next expansion cannot come soon enough for Warrior fans.
