Disaster has struck the Warrior class. After years of being the best weapon in the game, Blizzard have finally had enough and decided to nerf Fiery War Axe. It will be interesting to see how the class adapts after losing its most iconic and powerful card.

The first impressions are that Pirate Warrior will no longer be a viable deck. Almost all of Pirate Warrior’s strongest early game power plays revolved around Fiery War Axe and it’s hard to see the deck still being relevant when such an important tool is lost. There are a lot of issues in its curve as well; the deck now has nothing but Bloodsail Raider to play on turn 2, with replacements being limited to Faerie Dragon and Fire Fly. The 3 mana slot was already extremely competitive, and now it’s just too crowded. Bloodsail Cultist and Frothing Berserker were excellent follow ups to Fiery War Axe, and now their synergy with the card is heavily gimped.

As for other Warrior archetypes, things look concerning. For Control Warrior, Fiery War Axe was by far the best way of getting through the turbulent early turns, but the class now has so much early game mass removal that it might be tolerable. The trouble is that, with War Axe, goes the Warrior class’ insurance. It is such a good card and papers over so many cracks that without it, the class is now prone to irrelevance if the cards from the recent set aren’t good enough. It’s definitely a difficult time for Warrior fans.

Dog’s Control Fatigue Warrior, featuring two copies of Dead Man’s Hand and no Fiery War Axe, was good enough for him to take it to #2 legend last week, the best result for any Warrior deck not named Pirate since the release of Knights of the Frozen Throne. Whether this build remains relevant after the balance changes, it’s difficult to tell.
