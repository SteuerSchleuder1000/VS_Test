Druid finds itself as the third most played class at higher levels of play this week. Jade Druid’s power level has been growing every day, and while Aggro-Token Druid has fallen in its play rate since the balance changes, it is still very strong and is making a small comeback.

Snoobyboo has hit #1 legend with Casie’s Jade Druid. Mark of the Lotus builds are largely responsible for Jade Druid’s rise in win rate. Medivh is a very strong card in the mirror as well as against Priest, and ramping to him early can also help swing games against faster decks. Needless to say, it’s very hard to deal with an Atiesh-powered UI. Mark of the Lotus gets a lot of value in Jade Druid. In combination with Spreading Plague, it is a game-ending play against aggressive decks, and it can apply a lot of board pressure against slower decks since Jade Druid usually has multiple minions on the board. Having just three minions buffed by Lotus is already a very powerful tempo swing for one mana. Being a cheap card with high potential value makes it work really well with Ultimate Infestation, much like Jade Idol, since you’re incentivized to dump your hand as efficiently as possible. The single copy of Power of the Wild acts as a third Mark of the Lotus, and occupies the flex spot for this build. It can be replaced by pretty much anything depending on the meta. Senfglas hit #1 legend with a slightly different list, while Tyler took it to #1 as well. This build omits Medivh and Power of the Wild for two Mind Control Techs. The thinking behind MCT is that it’s a decent card against aggressive decks while also being strong in the mirror. The mirror often forces players to flood the board to win the Jade race, opening up a possible swing of MCT stealing a large threat.

Aggro-Token Druid remains very diverse in its build approach, and players are having success with many lists. Dshmitt’s list is the fastest and strongest in aggressive mirrors where you want early game consistency. NeutralMilk’s Hydra list provides more power against Jade Druid and Razakus Priest while maintaining a standard shell. Derpy’s Pilfered list looks to improve these matchups further and is the best approach against slower decks, but it does sacrifice early game consistency.

Finally, Big Druid has raised its head and is taking advantage of pocket meta’s at the highest levels where Priest and Jade Druid are extremely prevalent. Multiple players hit legend early this month with Pinilikute’s Big Druid, which maximizes ramp and late game greed to dominate the matchups the archetype excels at. The decline in aggressive decks may help Big Druid find a bigger niche in the current meta.
