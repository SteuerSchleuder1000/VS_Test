<p>Druids have undoubtedly taken a big hit with the balance changes. Jade and Aggro Token Druidís play rate has plummeted. However, both archetypes are still performing very well against the field, as they have found ways to stick around as powerful decks even with the loss of Druidís best card, Innervate.</p>
<p>Even at 6 mana, Spreading Plague is still an incredibly powerful card against aggressive decks, and remains a staple in <strong>Jade Druid</strong> builds. Most Jade Druids run two Mire Keepers in order to consistently ramp to Ultimate Infestation, a card that has remained unchanged. With the meta still in flux, keep an eye out for the deckís flex spots. Spellbreaker is one tech thatís almost always chosen, but other options include Mind Control Tech, Tar Creeper, Doomsayer, Golakka Crawler and Medivh. Zalaeís build runs Dirty Rats, which have synergy with Mind Control Tech and can disrupt Razakus Priests, Exodia Mages as well as control decks running Skulking Geist.</p>
<p><strong>Aggro-Token</strong> Druid has lost one of the most feared openers in the game: Innervate/Vicious Fledgling. Many people suspected that the deck would take a huge hit, due to how often Innervate can seemingly snowball the board out of control. However, the archetype remains very powerful, and holds a great matchup spread.</p>
<p>NeutralMilkís build is fairly similar to pre-patch builds, but drops Innervate/Fledgling. Instead, it includes Tar Creepers and Golakka Crawlers, which are pretty powerful cards in the current meta. Since the deck runs Crypt Lord, there is also merit to include a Crazed Alchemist if youíre running into a lot of Doomsayers.</p>
<p>Icerís build, with which he hit top 50 legend, is drastically different. It cuts Bittertide Hydras and most of the deckís 3-drops, which are much slower without Innervate, and includes Snowflipper Penguins. The Penguins are strong targets for Mark of YíShaarj, and offer the Druid a way to cheat out tokens and buff them without Innervate. Since the deck is faster and tends to empty its hand very quickly, Genzo finds its way into the build.</p>
