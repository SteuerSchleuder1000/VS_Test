Hunter continues to decline this week, especially as Tempo Rogue decks continue to improve and take over the top ranks. Although Hunter is still alright against two of the Big 3 (Razakus Priest and Jade Druid), these matchups are close to even, which doesn’t give Hunter much of a chance to become a reliable counter class. On the other hand, matchups against Tempo Rogue, Token Shaman and the growing presence of Zoo are bad enough to continue sinking the class.

Midrange Hunter’s poor matchup spread has also translated into mostly being absent in the the tournament scene. Only one player, OmegaZero, brought Hunter to the HCT Championship. His list is very similar to Feno’s build with small modifications. One Unleash the Hounds and one Hyena are cut for Tracking and Dire Wolf Alpha, while Deathstalker Rexxar replaces one Highmane.
