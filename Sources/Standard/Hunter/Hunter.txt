Right on the eve of the balance changes, Hunter finally got some decent results on ladder (albeit early in the season where competition is less fierce). Roast took his teched out Hybrid Hunter to #5 legend while Asmodai managed to hit #1 with a Midrange Hunter build.

Roast’s Hybrid Hunter relies more on snowballing out a win than most, with the inclusion of Fledglings over Bearsharks and Stitched Trackers. The Fledglings work well with the Deadly Shots to ensure the snowball effect happens, while also having synergy with Spellbreaker. The Fledglings also help tremendously against Jade Druid, where making one big threat is much stronger than building a board. The Flare and Hungry Crab can be swapped for Stitched Trackers if Murloc Paladins and Mages aren’t as popular.

Asmodai’s Midrange Hunter list is tuned more towards a wide board playstyle, with the pirate package included alongside Bearsharks. One of the most notable things about the list is the lack of 5-drops, which end up being too clunky in a deck in which you would often rather play a 2-drop and a 3-drop on turn 5. Stitched Tracker in particular allows the deck to get rid of this slot, smoothing out the curve without needing to include subpar cards. This list is worse against Druid due to the threat of Spreading Plague, but performs better against aggressive decks thanks to the pirate package.

Hunter showing the capability of performing well certainly indicates that Hunter has potential in a meta where almost everything else other than Priest is getting nerfed, and considering that Priest is not a bad matchup for the class, we could see Hunter climbing to a more competitive win rate after the balance changes go live.
