Hunter continues to decline in its play rate, and even the meta at lower ranks is turning more hostile for Hunter, most notably with Zoo Warlock on the rise. With Zoo on the upswing, Hunter decks are being forced to tech Unleash back, as seen with NickChipperâ€™s Barnes Hunter. The slew of late game threats in the deck make good Hunter matchups better, while there is still potential for a win against aggressive decks through high-rolls off Barnes or a powerful Hyena Unleash turn.
