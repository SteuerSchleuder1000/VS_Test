<p>Hunter took over the meta for a couple of days after the nerfs, but as Tempo Rogue has grown in popularity, Hunter play rate has fallen. An increase in one of its worst matchups alongside a decrease in the slow, experimental post-nerf control decks, have led Hunter to become a fairly middle-of-the-road class. At the moment, with the high number of Tempo Rogues and Token Shamans, itís become harder for Hunter to pick up wins. The class needs the meta to slow down a bit for it to thrive, as its matchups with Razakus Priest and Jade Druid (post-nerf) are fairly close.</p>
<p>The most important development in <strong>Midrange Hunter</strong> lists following the balance changes was the inclusion of Bittertide Hydras to beat Priests (and Druids). Razakus Priest only has one direct way to deal with a turn five Bittertide, so slamming it down, especially followed by a Highmane, just wins games against the most popular deck in the game. Deathstalker Rexxar is optional, but not a must include in Hydra lists since youíre looking to end games quickly.</p>
<p>The other major shift in Hunter is the inclusion of Fire Fly over the pirate package. The pirates are prone to the Golakka Crawler tech thatís fairly popular due to Tempo Rogueís meteoric rise. In addition, Bloodsail Corsairís ability is less relevant with the War Axe change. Fenoís rank 1 legend list is a good representation of a pirate-less Midrange Hunter, while TheBestís more recent top 10 legend list represents a pirate list. Both builds include the Unleash/Hyena package, which improves your odds of winning your worst matchups.</p>
