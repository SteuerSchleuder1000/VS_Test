Shaman is languishing as a one-trick pony deck as it continues to be only represented by one archetype: Token Shaman. Shaman’s growth is stifled mainly because of its poor matchup against one of most popular decks: Razakus Priest.

For the first time in a while, attempts to revive the archetype can be seen. Xixo has built a very interesting list that removes the situational cards in the Token Shaman deck while adding stronger stand-alone minions. Devolve, Bloodlust and the low pressure totems (Mana Tide, Primalfin and consequently TFB) are cut. Instead, the list includes Scalebanes, Cairne, Jade Sprits and Bonemares as well as Prince Taldaram, previously seen in Baize’s Summer Championship Shaman deck.

Another card that makes its appearance is Hemet. Hemet offsets the deck’s lack of card draw by removing low impact cards from your deck, improving your draw in the late game and making it easier for the Shaman to close out the game, which is one of its biggest struggles.

TrickyHunter hit #50 legend with a Corpsetaker Midrange Shaman build. Corpsetaker has great Synergy with Al’Akir, and one Argent Squire is added for more consistency landing the Divine Shield. Lightning Bolts are meant to remove the Rogue’s early game minions (Agents, Captains, Fledglings). As always, with almost every midrange deck out there, Scalebanes and Bonemares are included.
