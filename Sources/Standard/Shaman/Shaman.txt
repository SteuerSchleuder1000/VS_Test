The good news is that current Shaman decks have mostly been spared from Blizzard’s wrath. The bad news is that the meta shift resulting from the balance changes might not be entirely favorable for Shaman’s only current viable archetype: Token Shaman. Token Shaman traditionally has an edge against other aggressive decks, so a reduction in their representation results in a decrease in its power level. In addition, a rise in the Priest class is also a predicted trend that does not bode well for the class. The one cause for optimism is that the increased mana cost to Spreading Plague and the nerf to Innervate mean Shaman’s matchup against Jade Druid should improve. However, Spreading Plague should still be a very effective tool against the archetype. In addition, slower Shaman archetypes have been kicked while they were already down with the nerf to Hex. It’s tough to say whether these dormant archetypes could see more play as a result of the balance changes, but there is definitely no guarantee they will, since Shaman’s kit generally does not perform well against Jade Druid or Razakus Priest, which are predicted to stay powerful.
