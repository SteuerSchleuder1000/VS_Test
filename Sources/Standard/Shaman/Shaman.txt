Shaman continues to be a decent choice on the ladder, but it is sorely outshined by more popular and more powerful archetypes such as Tempo Rogue, Jade Druid and Razakus Priest. Token Shaman does well enough against Rogue and Druid, but has a difficulty tackling Priest, which drops its usage rate at higher levels of play.

Usage is not the only issue that is plaguing Shaman, but diversity as well. If you want to play Shaman with a respectable chance of winning, the only choice you have is Token Shaman. The deck has remained virtually unchanged since very early after the launch of KFT, and is extremely similar to the deck it was during the Un’Goro meta. The class is dying for something new and interesting that actually works, after most of its design space in KFT was dedicated to a new idea that’s still in its diapers and might never pan out: Freeze Shaman.
