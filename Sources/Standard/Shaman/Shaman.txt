<p>Shaman is reinvigorated with the recent changes to several top classes, namely Warrior and Druid. The classí usage rate and win rate have seen a significant uptick, as players are now experiencing more success with <strong>Token Shaman</strong>. The Jade Druid matchup has become more bearable with Spreading Plagueís increased cost, while the high number of aggressive decks on ladder provides Token Shaman with matchups that are decided by early board battles, something it excels at.</p>
<p>One thing that hasnít changed is Token Shamanís standard build, which remains exactly the same and the one with which AlwaysLucky hit #1 legend. The second Devolve and the Saronite Chain Gang are the two flex spots that are sometimes replaced. Two Chain Gangs can be quite strong in control matchups by curving into Thrall, Deathseer, while Golakka Crawlers are also common to target Rogues.</p>
<p>Other Shaman archetypes are pretty much dead. With the Hex nerf, they might be even weaker. Slow Shaman decks just canít mount enough pressure to bother Jade Druid and Razakus Priest, two archetypes with much more intimidating clocks.</p>
