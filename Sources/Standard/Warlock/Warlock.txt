<p>Prince Keleseth has become a staple in Zoo and is near-universally played. Satellite has been hovering at the top legend ranks with multiple iterations of a midrange build that tops at Bloodreaver Gulídan, another card thatís becoming a staple in Zoo (weíre featuring his latest build). HotMeowth was also seen in the top 100, with a Pirate list that takes advantage of the interaction of Keleseth and Patches. Both of these lists have slight discard elements with Malchezaarís Imp, Soulfire, and Doomguard, but weíre far away from Silverware Golem and other discard mechanics seeing the light of day again. They also include Vicious Fledging, which is a strong card against Jade Druid and Priest. Finally, the latest trend has been to run Blood Imps and Crystalweavers. Crystalweavers offer a powerful turn 4 play in an otherwise weak mana slot, while Blood Imp is a cheap demon that can buff some of your threats out of removal range, and works really well with Keleseth, Crystalweaver and Bonemare.</p>
<p>As for <strong>Control Warlock</strong>, Sjoesie piloted his heavily teched build to #25 legend, including an interesting selection of 3 drops and Prince Valanar, while Sjow had success with a more conventional build that runs Twilight Drakes. While Control Warlock has seen increased representation, please note that many of the most relevant decks are poor matchups for this archetype, and it might need further improvements or a meta shift to be consistent enough.† † †</p>
