While there seems to be no hope for Warlock in the current ladder meta, the upcoming balance changes provide us with a glimmer of hope. All flavors of Warlock struggled against Pirates, Murlocs, and Jade Golems. While it’s unlikely that the class will serve up a solution that beats all deck archetypes, it’s possible that the need for a wider spread of positive matchups will be lessened and more focused strategies can be used for success.

For Control Warlock, Pirate Warrior was one of its worst matchups and the loss of the premier 2 mana weapon in Fiery War Axe significantly lessens the early game pressure. Murloc Paladin wasn’t much better, but the removal of Warleader’s health buff should make Defile significantly more effective at clearing a wide board for minimal mana cost. This may give some opportunity for Control Warlock to shift to either a classic Handlock shell or even a highlander Kazakus/Krul build, such as Thijs’ experimental build listed here. Please take this with a huge grain of salt, as the Jade Druid problem will likely still exist for Control Warlock even with a more threat-dense build and Razakus Priest will likely increase in representation as well.

Midrange and/or Zoo Warlock do not have any lists for us to talk about now, but with the reduced presence of early game pressure from Pirates and Murlocs combined with the increased cost of Spreading Plague, there’s a possibility of the archetype returning to playability. Watch this space.
