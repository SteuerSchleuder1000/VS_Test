Warlock’s representation is holding stable just below the big 3 at all levels of play and Zoo Warlock is the deck most represented for the class. The archetype is continuing to deviate from standard lists. Wabeka hit top 10 legend this week with a lower curve list focused heavily on the early game and controlling the board with cards such as Glacial Shard, Dark Iron Dwarf and Deathspeaker allowing advantageous trades into the mid-game. The choice to not include Gul’dan is an interesting one and could well be correct. While the 10-mana card is certainly a powerful win condition that can often swing the game into an irrecoverable state for the opponent, most Zoo games are decided before turn 10. In addition, since we’re running Doomguards, Gul’dan is often discarded when it’s drawn early since it’s buried in your hand. Finally, in the matchups against Jade Druid and Razakus Priest, it’s arguable that if they do manage to survive to turn 10, you’re losing the game anyway, playing Gul’dan would sometimes not even matter, and it’s better to have a playable card before that point.

Control Warlock continues to show innovation but not high level results. If you’re looking for an interesting deck, Evangelion hit legend with a Control Warlock build centered on resource denial through discard and mill effects. It’s not recommended for serious ladder grinding but is recommended for having fun.
