Warlock continues to sit just outside of the Big 3 in terms of representation. We’re seeing Zoo continue to develop and change in its build, while Control Warlock is declining in its play rate due to being poorly positioned in the meta.

New Zoo Warlock builds are transitioning towards a bigger demon package as well as running Bloodfury Potion, which allows an early demon to get out of control quickly and either dominate the board or pressure the opponent’s life total. As such, demon synergies are well represented with Blood Imp and Crystalweaver seeing significantly more play while Fire Fly has started to lose favor.  Blood Imp, in particular, becomes a stronger card in a list that runs Bloodfury Potion.

Satellite hit #1 legend while Zanananan hit #6 legend with lists that embrace this approach. Zanananan’s list includes a pirate package with Southsea Captains while Satellite omits the pirates for Vicious Fledglings, and opts for a beefier mid-game that includes Cobalt Scalebanes.
