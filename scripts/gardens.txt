flower set

In the gardens of PW is a leisure plane. The residents are tasked to take care of the 
park like world but within fields of flowers, seas, temples, giant trees,
something is corrupting the flora and black thorns are beginning to spread.

The Garden is sized up so that flowers become trees, birds dragons and mice monsters
There are zoos, ships, libraries, botanica, planetaria,

story scenes: [annoectodes]
THE VAULT
- Kea has the glass key to the vault underneath Prague -> now she needs to get there:
Going down the aquaducts >> glowing floating fish light the way >> illusions guard the vault
deep down the shaft where air is difficult to breath they encounter the roots of the city tree
and a labyrinth ever changing it's layout >> kea can use her powers wisely

But somebody is following them. Their disguise above has failed >> the sphinx god himself is on the way
kea is inside the glass vault the crown of glass within her reach when the sphinx lands and sends tremors
throught the caverns. The crown descends into the abyss
Kea has to face the god or her team will be lost. When she walks outside the walls of the labyrinth have 
vanished and the team faces the sphinx and her knights. The sphinx gives the order and the battle ensues.

The team flees to the vault and Kea pulls them all inside safe from the attackers. The sphinx god begins
crushing the cube but they find a portal stone in last minute to get out.

They land in a snow storm and Kea reveals the crown.


CITY OF BLOSSOMS
-Kea has entered the city of Blossoms and old Italian city, sunny and friendly. Flower spirits roam about
and the city is bustling with travelers and sales people. She needs the contact of a librarian only known by
the code name the black rose. She rents a room and visits an underground boxing match. Kea looks for tatoos.
Each one tells a story some of them are written in god letters. They tell of a man who saved them from the se
during a storm. A man who deals with roses. She asks a guy a question. Nothing happens.

The match ends and kea wands to leave. She is stopped and the gang tries to interrogate her. A thorn elemental
appears as the team leader with the thorns piercing Keas arm even in ghost form. The poison lets her have 
another vision of the dream god which catapults her back to reality where she beats the thorn elemental.
It gives her a coin that she has to pay at a local library.

A woman enters the city with a cart full of cages. She gives the unseen beasts within something to
sniff at and opens the cages.

Kea visits the library. The librarian is actually an ancient ghost kept alive by an eternity stone. He leads
her in a back room where the schematics for the city of prague are stored. Kea feels something wrong and
vanishes. The 2 dogs appear bursting through wooden walls. Still injured Kea can not use her full power
She draws her sword and kills one dog and sends the other down a well.

The woman is pissed when they later pull up a gigantic dog from the well but she now knows where Kea will go
next. The woman and her poodle walk innto the crowd. The poodle looks sick coughing up black blood and leaving
behind bushels of his white fur. They encounter Kea who immediatly recognizes the woman.

The poodle transforms into a giant black wolf who oozes black goo from his mouth together they encircle Kea.
Flower knights appear and also circle kea. The woman can grow body parts.
The flower knights try to tie Kea down but it helps her escapes to the roofes. Hunted by the bounty hunter
the wolf and thorns she lets herself fall down into a house. Thorns burst through the side walls breaking 
open the secret entrance to the boxing area. 

A wounded poisened and tired Kea activates the same trap that knocked her out before and kills the bounty hunter

With the glass key she can now travel to Prgaue.



CITY OF RUST
Kea arrives to the bustling city. There's a festival going on with the 7 gods pilgraming through the street
throwing gold into the crowd. 

Kea wants to make a deal with the god of greed. 



SPIDER GOD
A traitor enters the spiders lair. He wants to sell secrets to the spider god. The spider god accepts and
rewards him. The traitor accepts an new offer to keep an eye on Kea. The spider god produces a wet 
stone eye from its abdomen and ask him to swallow it. He refuses > the guards take a stick and make him.

The spider agent can retrieve the last moments of a person from his eye.



the storm gods
The city is in a giant thunder storm. Mist ghosts roam the streets and witches jump from roof to roof. Kea
has to escort the wounded architect to the save house. Mist ghosts attack them and a witch hunter comes 
to the rescue trapping them in his steel cage.


Enter the dream
Kea and yevo + ritualists sit around an eternal and try to enter his mind. They do so by touching his 
sleeping body. They enter an inception style world where they encounter a hostile soul. Meanwhile in the 
real world blood from a small cut from the eternal is making it's way to a ritualist and taking over his body.

Kea recognizes the missing ritualist in the dream and wakes up in the last second. The ritualist still 
seemingly dreaming his holding a knife to yevos throat when kea obliterates him.

This is the moment where the eternal awakens but yevo is able to tie him down.



The music festival
In lantern city there's a music festival. Kea and team wander through the main plaza where lanterns are 
floating in the sky and a band is playing. There is an exchange going to happen and they're looking for a
guy with green hair. He shows up but takes 2 of Keas team hostage. Kea gives him the golden egg and the 
green guy vanishes into the crowd as do the hostage takers afterwards. 

Kea follows the green haired guy which is pinned down on the ground. The egg has become incredibly heavy and
is crushing his hand. Kea takes his backpack and picks up the egg now light again. The crowd has noticed the 
commotion and is backing up. The guy is furious and gives a signal which makes 10 big guys walk towards Kea
and team. 

Kea gets a hold of a low floating lantern and begins to climb upwards as they had planed before the exchange.
The lantern ghost inside shrieks.
The green haired guy reveals a pair of extra arms and shoots a projectile at the lantern which makes it tilt.
Befor it crashes in a fiery explosion kea manages to get a hold onto another lantern. The crowd is now in panic
and disperses. Meanwhile the guy shoots at them.

Kea reaches the big lantern which is towed with big chains and rushes down on one of them. 
Mission accomplished.



SNOW FOREST
Kea and her team arive in the snow withered monastary where they enjoy golden blossom team. The human lord
who is ensouled with a divine spirit tells her what she needs to know. He has a packet for her that her 
father left her. She opens it but it's a bomb tearing a giant hole into the monastary. The lord and kea 
are catapulted out of the building. The lord dies with the spritit splittering.

The honor guards circle her and accuse her of murder. She recognizes that the dream god has set her up
and flees with her team into a local forest.

There they need to battle a giant black snake.

Afterwards they travel for days to their next destination.




Assaniation in the Waterways
Kea has infiltrated the oasis and meets up with the local coconspiritor in the waterways.
His team seems nervous and distrustful but he never the less wants to hand her over the ring.
But in this moment he is stabbed multiple times by an invisible assailant which also steals the ring.

Kea goes after him following the water splashes. She manages to burn him. She looses him after some time.

Later in court she recognizes the burn mark on one of the judges.



The falconeer
Falcon races are popular in bronze city. Kea wants informations from a local sha. He challenges her to a 
falcon race. The falcons fly around five towers. His falcon has hidden blades on the claws and injures Keas
falcon. The Sha now in the lead makes an even better offer. Kea agrees.

Her team mate makes the blades grow very heavy which makes the falcon fall to his death and kea wins.





black river
A boy wanders through the markets of an Egyptian city and steals a fish. He runs to the river to 
bite into it but hesitates. He sees black water running down his feet. More and more of it. Other people
have noticed it too. The boy sees a rugged something floating to his feet. Bumping into the river quai the
black object turns over and reveals itself to be a dead body in armor.

Screaming the boy runs back to the market place leaving behind the stolen fish.




Eye of justice
Outside the Roman arena children sell weird red glass sculptures to the incoming crowd.

The arena chants and cheers. It's afternoon and the sun burns on the sand. The city god watches
on as a man in chains is brought before him. The gods voice halls through the arena and the crowd goes 
silent. He accuses the man of treason and praying to the false god. The man begs and cries for forgiveness.
The god opens the lense of a giant eye on the light house across the city. "The eye will judge you"

The man bursts into flames as the heat ray focuses on him. The crowd roars. The sand around him begins to 
melt and mingles with the flow of blood. As the eye closes its lid the glass freezes into the sculptures 
the kids sell outside.



The map
The negremo leaves the port in the dark of the night. Kea's father is the cartographer on board and is being
sent on a secret mission using the map drawn by the atlas god himself. The map is encoded and only works under
certain star constelations at specific positions on the map as it continuesly changes form.

Both the crew and captain are from Rust city hardened by the sea. Kea's father has been gifted the gift of 
"star sight" where he can see through objects and see the stars even in broad daylight. The captain meanwhile
is gifted the gift of "the ancor".

The boat is small and very fast and they soon leave the islands of the iron empire. They see flocks of
rainbow colored birds crossing the ocean, gigantic eels surfacing, star showers and echoing mist.

After two weeks they reach the first marker point. Once again the map transforms and shows the way leading
between two mountains. There they make first contact with the thunder king and his navy. Posing as 
merchant travellers they are offered stay in the royale palace on the main land. 

Their ship is secured with additional ancors and they are invited for dinner with the god king himself. during
which their cover as merchant is uncovered and they're taken hostage as potential spies.
Through their gifts they manage to escape but a droplet of ink is sprayed onto the map.

Soon the split mountain lays before them and they meet the god of the sea. He asks for half the crew as a toll.
They discover that he is actually not the god and battle him and win.

They enter the sea of ever lasting night. The sea is completely still mirroring the night sky above. As they 
reach their destination nothing happens at first. But then the map transforms into an egg which cracks and 
reveals a star the gift of light.

The droplet of ink from the god king has transformed into a bug and flies of.





The dream
Kea is imprisoned in a cell, chained to the wall. She closes her eyes and begins to sleep. A butterfly 
flies through the window and lands on her forehead. 

Kea walks though wooden constructs which spanns hell and heaven. From beneath the orange glow of heat is
eminating. A butterfly flies through the scene leading her to a chamber in the timber with a cube like 
building in its middle.

In its middle a golden cocoon is hanging from the ceiling. The cube transforms and the landscape changes 
into  a desert under the night sky. There are blue glowing foot steps leading her through the sand to a 
oasis and again in its middle the wooden cube. She enters it but a river of water pushes her out. Suddenly 
she is underwater with lightning in on the surface. A dark figure floats before her with a dark shadow 
construct forming behind her back. It opens and reveals to be butterfly wings with glowing orange eyes.

Kea panics and wakes. The shadows on the cell wall show a butterfly flying away.




The light house
Keas ship enters the lantern city. A giant lantern tower lights the port. They visit the city and eventually
go to the light tower. The walls are made of painted paer with a spiraling path going upwards inside the tower
As she goes upwards she notices the black butterflies in the paintings and the effect they seem to have on
the people. The last image shows a giant butterfly in the sky. Suddenly the orange eyes open and the 
butterfly flies away. As she looks on the images again they have gone back to normal.

- not as many units -> max 8
- shorter time -> 20min
- rank 2 -> 3 extremely tedious
- first round why?
- icons shitty
- items too complicated -> too litle time
- path -> matchmaking, 
- clear upgrades
- voice overs

Personally found it decently entertaining espcially when they showed some of the more rare archetypes (bunnyhoppors Pogo-Hopper deck)
